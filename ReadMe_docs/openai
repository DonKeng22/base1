Hereâ€™s a sharpened roadmap to build Projectâ€¯Odysseusâ€”the Hockey Analytics Core (HAC)â€”from research foundations to deployment in agentic systems:

ðŸ”¬ 1. Research Foundations & Dataset Assembly
1.1 Leverage Sports/SportsPose datasets

Use existing datasets like SportsPose (176k dynamic 3D poses across various sports) to pre-train pose models

.

While HARPET focuses on ice hockey, it demonstrates the success of pose + optical flow for action (~85% accuracy)

. Adapt this for field hockey.

1.2 Build a custom Field Hockey dataset

Define action labels (e.g., pass, shot, dribble, tackle).

Download high-quality game footage from YouTube, Internet Archive, Hugging Face.

Apply shot detection (via PySceneDetect), keyframe sampling, and sample segmentation.

1.3 Annotation strategy

Use CVAT for bounding boxes (players, ball, stick), keypoints (COCO-style skeletons + stick), and clip-level action tags.

Archive metadata in PostGIS for geometry indexing.

ðŸ§  2. Pipeline Architecture
Phase 0â€”Environment Setup
Ubuntu 22.04 (or WSL2), RTX 4070, CUDA 12

Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit

Containers for PostgreSQL/PostGIS, CVAT, MinIO (or shared volume), Shared SSD directories.

Phase 1â€”Data Acquisition & Cataloging
Build Python scripts to:

Download from sources (yt-dlp, archive.org, Hugging Face).

Insert metadata into PostgreSQL.

Process videos: shot detection, clip segmentation, keyframe extraction.

Store in SSD and log frame/clip metadata in DB.

Phase 2â€”Annotation Engine
Deploy CVAT via Docker.

Automate:

Export un-annotated keyframes to tasks via PostgreSQL queries.

Create CVAT projects for detection, pose, action.

Parse completed annotations into COCO/YOL-Oriented structures and store in dataset folders.

Phase 3â€”Model Training
3A: YOLOv8-Pose Detector

Inputs: annotated keyframes.

Framework: Ultralytics YOLOv8-Pose.

Fine-tune for players, ball, stick, keypoints.

3B: Multi-modal Action Recognition

Use OpenMMLab's mmaction2 â€“ models like SlowFast or MViT.

Input streams: frames + pose keypoints sequences (2D).

Leverage two-stream architecture: pose + optical flow, as per the HARPET precedent (~85%)

.

3C: AI-assisted Geometric Analysis

Implement frame-to-field homography (user calibration via clicks on field corners).

Compute real-world coordinates: player speed, ball velocity, shot angles, formation metrics, possession.

3D: On-Demand Super-Resolution (ESRGAN)

Fine-tune on hockey-specific low/high-res patch pairs.

Called selectively when cropped area confidence is low (e.g., blurry ball or jersey number).

ðŸ§© 4. HAC Integration & API
Build HockeyAnalyticsCore class in Python:

Load YOLOv8-Pose, Action Classifier, ESRGAN.

process_frame(frame):

Detect objects & poses.

Buffer pose sequences for each track ID.

Run action classifier per player.

Compute geometry & output Game State JSON as per your schema.

Wrap with FastAPI: /process_video_frame endpoint.

Optionally build video agent: loop over frames, collect game events, stream structured output for downstream systems (coaches, broadcasters, analytics agents).

ðŸ¤– 5. Agentic Applications & Extensions
Live Tagging Agent: monitors HAC output to trigger events (goals, penalty corners), clip them, and push to dashboards.

Tactical Decision Agent: based on formations and possession, recommends substitutions, set-play strategies, or predicts scoring likelihood.

AR/UX Agent: overlay real-time analytics (e.g., player speeds, passes) on video for broadcast or coaching.

ðŸ“Š Summary Roadmap
Phase	Outcome
Foundation	Pre-trained pose/action backbones, dataset assembled
Pipeline	Acquisition â†’ Annotation â†’ Training
Sub-modules	Detection+Pose, Action Recognition, Geometry, SSR
Integration	HAC core + API
Agentic Tools	Event clipper, Tactical advisor, AR overlays

âœ… Next Steps
Audit computational & storage needs for video pipelines (e.g., shot detection, storage volume).

Prototype data ingestion from one source (e.g., YouTube) and database logging.

Pilot annotation & YOLOv8-Pose fine-tuning using a small annotated batch.

Implement two-stream action classifier with pose + flow features.

Integrate homography & geometric computations on test clips.

Wrap HAC module with API and simulate agentic clients (e.g., clip generation, suggestion agents).

Evaluate end-to-end performance on held-back test video clips.
